# tornado-visualizations
Visualizations of tornado data in the United States from 1950 to 2018. The visualizations were made using Tableau. The purpose of this project was to investigate how frequent and dangerous the tornadoes in the United States have been and their distribution throughout the country.

## Data
For this project, I have created visualisations of tornado occurrences in the United States of America from 1950 to 2018 inclusive. The data includes a variety of fields – the ones that are relevant to this project are listed below:
- Tornado number (om)
- Date and time of tornado occurrence (year, month, day, date, time)
- State of tornado occurrence
- F-scale or magnitude
- Injuries
- Fatalities
- Starting latitude and longitude of the tornado

The data was obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center. The website’s link is https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data.

## Project Aims 
The aim of this project is to visualise the tornado occurrences in the U.S. using the dataset obtained above. The focus will be on:
- Mapping out the locations of each storm occurrence on the U.S. map
- Visualising the trends and patterns between casualty numbers and tornado frequencies over the years
- Visualising the trends and patterns between casualty numbers and tornado frequencies with respect to each state
- Highlighting trends on casualty numbers based on the magnitude

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse the distribution patterns of the storms, and how frequent and dangerous the tornadoes have been.

The distribution patterns of the tornadoes can be helpful as it identifies where the hotspots of the storms are, as well as finding out how often a certain area could expect the storms to happen, if any.

It is also useful to know how frequent and dangerous these storms can be. This is because it helps create more awareness in terms of how people prepare for the storms. The data visualisations can help expose how unsafe each tornado magnitude is based on the casualty trends and patterns.
